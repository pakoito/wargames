# Smalltricks

Smalltricks is a quick game about the first engagement between two Factions, a game of chess' opening moves, a game of parry and riposte.

Games are short and brutal.

# Components

4-8 dice

1 Hexagonal boardgame: (flat top, 6x6)

One tracking card

# Rules of a Match

A Smalltricks match is played in a series of short games, of any amount of your choice or as time permits or the players agree to: single match, best of 3, best of 5, first to 10...

### Components

Players are called **Factions** in the game.

The board represents a **Battlefied** is split in half, each half belonging to a Faction.

The top or bottom border row of their corresponding half is the **Castle** of that Faction.

Each dice in the board represents a Unit and belongs to one Faction. Units are the main pieces of the game, and will move, use skills and deal damage to make a Faction win the game.

### Building your Faction

Preparing the Unit composition and starting position of your Faction is half of the fun of the game. Units come in multiple types, each with rules and abilities that make them unique and create rock-paper-scissors situations between them.

# Playing a game

The objective of each Smalltricks Game is for the Units of one Faction to score more damage to the opponent's Castle than their opponent's, before the Game ends.

## Games, Rounds and Turns

Pick a First and Second Faction for the Game. These alternate between Games of a Matches. Pick or roll the First Faction for the first Game.

Each Game is played in Rounds. A Round consists of 3 phases: the First Faction Turn, the Second Faction turn, and the Resolution Turn.

### The end of the Game

A Game ends when it feels like it is done, generally 5-7 Rounds. This is understood between the players when both Factions have taken losses and the options now are limited to retreating and rearming, where Factions would need several rounds of slowly manouvering to score, or scoring is too simple because there are few Units left in the **Battlefield** to defend.

The winner of the Game is the Faction that has dealt the most damage to the opponent's Castle. If the damage is even and a Faction has overwhelmingly more Unit power left they are considered the winner. This could mean the game ends in a draw if there is no clear winner.

This is a game of alpha strikes, so if one Faction has scored at the cost of their Units, the fact that the other Faction can spend 4-5 rounds counter-attacking to score didn't make them the winner. This smoothens over time because to win a Match is to be the winner of several Games, so Players have to be flexible with these rulings.

### Faction Turns

During a Faction turn, the Player gets to activate all of their Units. They activate the Units one by one, moving the Unit according to their type. A Unit cannot be activated twice in the same turn.

### Resolution Turn

During the Resolution turn, several sub-turns are resolved in order:

- Combats: Opposing Units in the same hexagon are considered Engaged and have to resolve a Combat. All combats are considered to resolve simultaneously.
- Melee Abilities: Melee abilities from Units not Engaged are applied now.
- Ranged Abilities: Ranged abilities from Units not Engaged are applied now.
- Castle Damage: Any unit in an opposing Castle row that is not Engaged deals damage to the castle.

## Units on the battlefield

Units are how Factions interact with each other. They occupy hexagons on the Battlefield, and adhere to some rules.

### Engagement

A Unit is considered Engaged if they are in the same hexagon as a Unit of an opposing Faction.

An Engaged unit cannot move (??? TODO), cannot use Abilities and cannot damage a Castle.

### Two Units per Faction limit

Each hexagon can contain up to two units of the same Faction. That means each hexagon can have up to four units, two of each Faction.

### One-and-two Engagements

If a Faction has a single Unit in a hexagon, and the opposing faction has two, the Player of the Faction with the single Unit decides which opposing Unit is Engaged for the purpose of preventing their Abilities to trigger during the Resolution Turn.

The Faction with the unit that remains not Engaged can choose in the Resolution Turn whether to Engage to resolve a Combat or use their Abilities instead.

### Castle Damage

To score damage, a Unit must be in the Castle row while not Engaged at the end of a Resolution Turn.

### Movement

Units can move in any of the 6 directions or stay in their hexagon. Follow the rules of the Unit type.

### Range and LoS

Ranges are calculated counting hexagons from the origin, in any of the possible movement directions. There are no LoS requirements in Smalltricks.

## Death

When a Unit has take all damage they allow and their life is reduced to 0 or less, they are immediatelly removed from play.

## Combat

Combat is resolved as the first sub-turn of the Resolution Turn.

Units Engaged in a Combat, up to two per Faction due to the limit per hexagon, deal 2 damage per Unit Engaged. The damage can be divided any way they choose between any opposing Units Engaged in the same Combat.

Damage is resolved simultaneously.

Repeat the process for all Combats in the Battlefield.
