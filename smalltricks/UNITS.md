## Units

Units are what your Faction is composed of. They are arranged in a power triangle where Spears -> Mounted -> Archers -> Spears, and the other units throw the balance off.

### Base Stats

Unless a special rule applies, All Units can move 1 hexagon per Movement, have a Range of 0, deal 2 damage in Combat, and have 5 points of life.

### Unit Types [Dice Face]

#### Archers \[1\]

- Volley (Ranged Ability): Deal 2 damage to a Unit in Range 2.
  - -1 damage if this Unit has moved this turn.
  - -1 damage if the target is not the same as last time this ability was used, i.e. choosing a new target, or coming out of an Engagement.

#### Cannon \[2\]

- Mortar Fire (Ranged Ability): If this Unit has not moved, it deals 1 damage to all opponent Units in a hexagon in Range 2.

#### Mounted \[3\]

- Charge (Movement Ability): Move 1 additional hexagon this turn. If you move 2 hexagons and end in a hexagon where you Engage with one or two opponent Units, deal 2 damage to one the Units of your choice. You can move through hexagons with 2 Units of your Fation, but you cannot end movement there.
  _NOTE: Spears can counter Charge, dealing the damage to this Unit instead._

#### Assault Beasts \[4\]

- Trample (Movement Ability): This Unit can move even when Engaged. (TODO ??? When entering an hexagon with opponent Units, deal 1 damage to each Unit.)

#### Spears \[5\]

- Pierce (Melee Ability): Deal 1 damage to a unit in Range 1.
- Counter Charge (Movement Ability): If this Unit is (??? TODO in Range 1 of) the hexagon that is the target of a Charge by an opponent Mounted Unit, then the Mounted Unit's charge deals no damage and the Mounted Unit receives 3 damage instead.

#### Jesters \[6\]

- Taunt (Movement Ability): Instead of moving, this Unit can force an opponent Unit in Range 1 to move into their hexagon.

### Alternative Unit Types [Suggested Dice Face]

You can use these units instead of the basic ones to spice things up. It is recommended to always keep the Archers-Mounted-Spears trifecta.

#### Muskets \[2\]

- Fire! (Ranged Ability): (??? TODO If Muskets did not move this turn,) Deal 1 damage to all opponent Units in hexagons in the same column as the Muskets.

#### Aerial \[4\]

- Assault (Movement Ability): Move to any hexagon without a Unit in it, nor any hexagon of the opponent's Castle.

#### Commander \[4\]

- Forward! (Movement Ability): Instead of moving, force another allied Unit in Range 2 to move 1 hexagon.

#### Militia \[6\]

- Rowdy Crowd: Only 1 Militia Unit per Faction per hexagon.

- Melee expertise: This unit deals 3 damage in Combat.

#### Battery Ram \[6\]

- Crash Through (Melee Ability): If this Unit is at the opponent's Castle and is not Engaged, you win the Game.
