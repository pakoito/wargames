# draft-0.1

First version of the game

- Board is flat-top so the center and the castle are asymmetric and makes for more intesting plays
- Board is 6x6 to enable Mounted and require 3 Units to protect all hexagons of the castle
- Board is 6x6 because 5x5 or 6x5 is asymmetric between players
- 6 Unit types and 3 Alt units
